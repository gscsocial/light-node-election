GSC Light Node Election Rule

GSC's consensus mechanism uses ADPOS (Account-Delegated Proof-of-Stake), which is created by a trusted account (the trustee, the top 23 in the number of votes) elected by the community. The speed node refers to the collection of transaction information in the GSC network and the nodes packed into the block, also known as "the block producer (Block Producers, BPs) ", its feature is that the block time is short, high efficiency. The node is the basis of the GSC network, the 23 trusted accounts are GSC speed nodes (and there are 50 standby nodes), which produce all block records of the GSC network. 

The Light Nodes are the core of the construction of the public ecosystem basis of GSC. It is of great significance to the sustainable and stable operation of ecology. Since its launch, GSC has won the support of a great number of users, project partners and cooperation partners. Now we decided to improve the rights of the GSC holders and to give them the right to participate in the decision-making process of the community. The users holding GSC can vote and witness the emergence of candidates.
